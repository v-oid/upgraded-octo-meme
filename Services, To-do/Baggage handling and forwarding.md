## Takkyubin
- takkyubins (宅急便) are luggage shipping/forwarding services
- they are located in hotels and airports
- it is highly recommended to have them forward your big luggages to your hotels, so you don't carry them with you onto the trains
- there are some same-day services, but most will take 1 day (overnight). Therefore, it is recommended that you pack a smaller day bag with your essentials
