## IC Cards (Suica)
- IC cards are like transit passes and can be used on virtually all public transportation, as well as a credit card in most convenience stores and other shops/restaurants
- Suica is a specific IC card, and belongs to the big 10. All big 10 cards are interchangeable and has no difference in use. They are just sold in different regions of Japan
- Suica and Pasmo are sold in Tokyo
- It is recommended that you purchase them once you arrive in Japan

## JR Pass
- JR Pass will cost ~$500
	- I ran some cost estimation, and buying the JR pass and just straight up paying for the tickets will run roughly the same amount, you save a little bit by buying JR but cost varies from the official website vs. local dealers in Vancouver and Toronto
- JR Pass need to be bought no more than 3 months earlier
- The JR Pass will need to be picked up at the airport. You get an exchange ticket here
- JR Pass can be used to reserve seats on the trains
- There are two tiers: Green and Ordinary. Green is the "Business class"
- JR Pass is used on the big trains to travel between cities in Japan
- JR Pass can also be used on the Yamanote line of the Tokyo subway system, you can find the subway map below
	- The Yamanote line includes the checkered grey line and the thin grey line that runs through it. You can probably get to major locations using just the Yamanote line. But to use the majority of the Tokyo subway lines, you will need to pay with IC
