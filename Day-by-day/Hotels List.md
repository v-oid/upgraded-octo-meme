## Tokyo
- #### Districts:
	- Seems like Shinjuku is the best area to stay. The vibe overall is big city, bright neon lights, lots of restaurants, bars, shopping. Most recommended/popular with first time tourists
		- Cons:
			- few people mention it's "seedier" or a bit dirtier compared to other parts of Tokyo, but still clean by big city standards
			- the Shinjuku station is apparently is massive maze with 200 exits
	- Other options:
		- Shibuya: Just south of Shinjuku, also big metropolitan area, slightly younger than Shinjuku
		- Asakusa: Other side of the city (East) from Sinjuku/Shibuya, completely different vibe: more old tokyo, old Japanese style, historically a Samurai district
