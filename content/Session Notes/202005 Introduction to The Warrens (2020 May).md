## Session Summary

^991e2a

After doing the Kobolds enough favours, we were introduced to the underground city of [[The Warrens]]. It was massive with many different shops and a diverse group of races. It is headed by the Red Queen. We also met [[Oresteia, Lady of the Flame]] here. We met [[Dupont]] and the rest of Gnome Depot here. where we acquired the Extend-o-Grape (later renamed Judgement) and identified the mysterious sword as a mixture of iron and silver, and of Feywild origin. We also bought some pearls and rings from [[Tiny]] at All That Glistens. We also met [[Diana, the Seeker]] at the Grinning Harpy tavern.
