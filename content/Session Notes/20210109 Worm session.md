## Session Summary

We made our way through an obsidian forest. We encountered a bunch of what seemed like twisted, corrupted dryads. They sang a song that used to be a dryad song. Maybe whatever afflicted the trees turned the dryads into these... things. As the song fades, I feel vertigo. I drop to the ground and then... I can sense it. The Obelisk. I know what I must do... I know where I need to go... We encountered the obsidian worm afterwards, and had to make our way across a plain of glass shards. Through cunning, bravery and a stupid amount of luck, we made it out unscathed. ^210573

%%I don't know why this is happening to me. Is my faith in Silvanus not enough? Am I truly a cursed existence? I must not falter. Oh old Oak Father, return me to the Great Cycle...%%
