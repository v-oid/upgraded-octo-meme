A tower of Bahamut was discovered deeper into [[The Swamp]]. Here, we found illusionary hexes disguising a fetid rot into a gourmet feast, and curses laid upon the emblem/shield of Bahamut. Atop the tower, we faced off against our first foe, a cursed abomination that was quickly smited by an enraged and enlarged Hope.
