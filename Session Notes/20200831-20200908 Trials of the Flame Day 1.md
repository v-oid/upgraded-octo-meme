## Session Summary

We started the Trials of the Flame to become citizens of the Warrens. The initial ceremony had masked people come out and present us with crystals containing the souls of their ancestors. The event was called "Races for Honour, Glory and Position" There was a race and we rechead a river crossing portion eventually. We had to put the crystals into a slot on a boat, which started a silence spell that we must maintain. Some other group tried to screw us over so Aelar minor illusioned some noise on their ship and they got pulled down by some monster in the river. RIP. A monk or something survived from that party and tried to kill Aelar (actually succeeded), but Arrn was able to sacrifice his holy reliquary and ask Silvanus for divine intervention.
At one point we came across a Smokestone Obelisk. Arrn came under influence of it and became cursed. He dreamed of being an offering on a stone plinth, with the curled fingers of the Obelisk beckoning towards him. All will be well if I touch that obelisk again. All will be well.....

## Recap of last session



## Log

**

-   Some people in the crowd are wearing masks
    

-   Black masks and black robes
    
-   Red masks and red robes
    

-   People are organized into teams
    
-   This honours ancestors
    
-   Oresteia and the crowd makes a hand gesture with first 3 fingers curled
    

-   This causes masked people (masks of creatures of legend) to come out and stream towards the participants
    
-   They gave us white crystals which contains the spirits of their ancestors
    

-   Event name: Races for Honour, Glory and Position
    
-   When we put the crystals inside the slots, words starts to speak into our mind
    

-   One of us must keep the ritual so that they do not notice us
    
-   Something about something slumbering below
    

-   Then runes for silence warding beings to appear and one of us must keep it up
    
-   I sacrificed my piece of Sacred Oak to revive Aelar
    

-   I conducted a ritual to thank Silvanus for the miracle he performed
    
-   He acknowledged my thanks
    

-   ### A presence looms over me while I sleep
    

-   I tried to open my eyes but I could not like sleep paralysis
    
-   I was lying on a small stone plinth, an altar for offering, and gazing up at a Smokestone obelisk (the one that we saw before)
    

-   It is grasping at me
    
-   Feels like it isn’t straight, but curved like a long beckoning finger to me
    
-   I feel a whisper in the back of my mind that says “Join us”
    

-   I still feel a need to touch that obelisk and I know exactly where it is
    

-   I know exactly it is 10753(?) steps to it
    
-   If I touch that obelisk, then everything would be fine and I would be happy and where I should be
