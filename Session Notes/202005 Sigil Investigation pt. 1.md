## Session Summary

We made our way to the [[The Sigil]], a centre for learning but not every one is allowed in. We met Keeper Ember, a fire Genasi. The order of the Keepers are the only group within the Warrens who are allowed to worship gods, and the only god they can worship is [[Ioun, the Goddess of Wisdom]]. There has been lots of books going missing and they want us to figure out what's going on

## Log

**

-   Clark the Kobold Clerk – Receptionist/Secretary
    

-   Things have been going missing in the old sections of The Sigil
    

-   Been happening for a month
    
-   Transmutation magic detected in the air, very faint
    
-   Disappears in groups near the center, one or two at a time when on the outskirts
    
-   Book Titles
    

-   Odius’s History of Race
    
-   ## Odius – Vol. 2 On Fire Genasi – Missing recently
    

-   Fire Genasi often have identity crisis because they live between two worlds
    

-   Each individual is bound to a single plane
    
-   However, since Genasi are born of a mortal (Mortal Plane) and a Efreeti (Elemental Plane of Fire), some actually are bound to the Plane of Fire
    

-   Those Fire Genasi that are bound to the Plane of Fire feels outcasted/homesick in the Mortal Plane, and prefers the Elemental Plane of Fire instead
    
-   A lot of the are ostracized because they are born of two Planes
    

-   They like to associate with other Genasi due to this
    

-   The mating of ANY mortal race (human, elf, half-orc, etc.) and an Djinni (Efreeti, Djinn, Dao,) always results in a Genasi
    

-   Odius theorizes that the heavy magical nature of Djinnis overwrites other blood lineages
    

-   The offspring of Djinni and Mortals should be VERY RARE, the population here at the Warrens is Heavily Skewed, we should not be seeing this many Genasi naturally
    
-   One instance, a Half-Orc mother gave birth to a Genasi and they were both banished for not having the Shaman’s approval
    

-   And so she hated the child for having brought upon the misfortune upon her
    

-   The Locate Object spell successfully cast, but I could not detect it initially within 1000 ft of me inside the Stone Tome Room
    

-   Odius Vol. 2 – On Fire Genasi
    
-   Not detected anywhere near the Sigil either
    

-   The Sigil: a center for learning but not everyone is allowed in
    

-   Sound-proofed walls with mushrooms (!!!)
    
-   All wooden structures
    
-   Dimly light by mushrooms (different from the outdoor mushrooms, which are incandescent)
    
-   First area:
    

-   Open to the public
    
-   Parchment paper
    

-   Second area, needed Ember’s key to access
    

-   Stone slate records, carved
    
-   Made to fit, each slate only fit one hole basically
    

-   Very large, squat, heavy and wide
    
-   There is a reception with a kobold, he likes that I am interested in history
    
-   I meet a Male Fire Genasi – Keeper Ember
    

-   Ashy-grey skin, dark blue (lapis lazuli) colored large coat
    
-   He’s called a Keeper, seems important
    
-   Not happy about the fact that Ioun is the only God allowed to be worshipped
    
-   He is a fire genasi, but he works in library (easy burn) – good for Arrn to remember
    
-   Also he is a very kind and gentle man, unlike fires – good for Arrn to remember
    

-   The Order of the Keepers
    

-   The only group of practicing worshippers of Gods permitted in the Warrens
    
-   The Goddess Ioun is the only God permitted to be worshipped in The Warrens (!!!)
    

-   Keeper Ember doesn’t like this fact
