## Session Summary

We were told by the Kobolds to recover another one of their armories. As we descened a hole, we came to an underground cavern with a river running through it. The river had anti-magical properties. We faced off against several Ropers and Kuo Toa before coming to a large clearing. The river pooled into a lake with a whirlpool in the middle. That turned out to be an Octandryl, and we found ourselves severely outmatched. Out of desperation, Aelar offered to Tha'Ed: "Save me. I'll give you anything". We were then whisked away to what seemed like a place outside of normal flow of time. It was a white expanse, where Tha'Ed made each of us offers: to Hope and Arrn, she asked us to be her Warlocks. We told her to fuck off and were whisked away. She had no interest in Aelar, and Lilan offered her a favour of her choosing with no limits, and she melted the Octandryl as a result. We retrieved a set of staff and dagger (?). The second armory turned out to not be an armory at all, but rather a laboratory. Everything was written in Draconic, and we took some alchemical mixtures with us and left.

## Log


**

-   We left the gear in the hidden area because kobolds were moving about. We descended the hole and came into a cavern with a large stream
    
-   Lilan fell into the river, I tried to save him but he failed to point out the roper behind me. I got roped and took 10 damage
    
-   I carved out the last roper tendril
    
-   Arrn incinerated a Kuo Toa that was left on 1 hp from a Aelar’s Signature Mix FireballTM
    

-   Add on to mental burden/trauma
    
-   Less confidence in own abilities
    

-   ## Aelar’s Folly
    
-   Aelar said to Tha’Ed: “Save me. I’ll give you anything”
    

-   Then we were whisked away to a white expanse with nothing in sight
    
-   Aelar is standing ahead of the three of us
    
-   We heard Aelar say those words as it faded into the distance
    
-   Tha’Ed appears in front of Aelar
    
-   Tha’Ed asked me to be her Warlock, I told her to fuck off and she whisked me away to reality
    
-   Lilan offered her a favour of her choosing with no limits, she melted the Octandryl
    

-   We retrieved the staff and dagger
    
-   Second Armory:
    

-   The doors not as tall, human sized
    
-   Otherwise, architecture is similar
    
-   It actually wasn’t an armory, but a laboratory
    
-   Everything was in Draconic, Aelar took some potions and possible firebombs (has a fuse/wick)
    

-   Bribed Rusty with 25 GP to get our stuff from our stash back
