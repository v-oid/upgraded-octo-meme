## Session Summary

This was the session where we attempted the second trial, the trial of combat? We fought another party and it was tough but then Shades started descending from the sky and started killing everyone. They wanted to take the ancestor crystals. The trials were interrupted and we were sent off to retrieve the stolen crystals or at least find out where the Shades went.
