## Log


**

-   The Teeth: stalagmites and stalactites that separates the upper and lower districts
    
-   Very strong Transmutation magic in the center
    
-   Very faint Transmutation on the bookshelves along the outskirts of the tablet area
    

-   Along with very very faint illusion magic on 1 specific missing tablet
    
-   When I moved closer to the center, the illusion magic became a bit stronger
    
-   Illusion weaves through the bookshelves, which includes quite a few of the places where the books were missing
    
-   Going slowly towards the center as it gets stronger
    
-   The illusion magic leads to a point of strongest where we detect conjuration
    

-   A short ways from the center, 25ft from the outermost area where the center books have disappeared
    

-   Hope stumbled upon a small pellet of fur and bones
    

-   No magic from this pellet
    
-   It is from a rock mouse (a common pest in the Warrens)
